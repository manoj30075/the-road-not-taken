## Project Structure

The project structure follows a standard React application layout with separate directories for components, pages, hooks, services, and utilities. The main entry point is `src/main.tsx`, and the core application logic resides in `src/App.tsx`.

- `src/components`: Reusable UI components organized by feature or responsibility
- `src/pages`: Top-level page components representing distinct application views
- `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for encapsulating complex logic or stateful behaviors
- `src/services`: Modules for interacting with external APIs or services
- `src/utils`: Utility functions and helper modules
