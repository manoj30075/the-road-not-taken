- `src/components`: Reusable UI components organized by feature or responsibility
- `src/pages`: Top-level page components representing distinct application views
- `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for encapsulating complex logic or stateful behaviors
- `src/services`: Modules for interacting with external APIs or services
- `src/utils`: Utility functions and helper modules
